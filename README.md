# MagicMirror

Following on from my daughter and I building a couple of magic mirrors, there was a lot of interest in creating a how to. 

On this site you will find a basic howto as well as a complete RPi image and a couple of scripts to make creating a MM really easy. This guide works on the assumption you have a raspberry pi and it's connected to a monitor and cabled to the network. 

Part 1: Complete pre-configured MagicMirror Image (message comments edited to avoid embarassing "Hey Sexy!" messages). This version pulls the news from the BBC site. This image auto starts Magic Mirror on boot and stops the monitor from sleeping. Just take the img file and write it to an SD card, following these instructions: 



This Image was last updated on 22/09/2018.

Take the SD card and put it in a Raspberry Pi and MM will start and away you go. Take a look at https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/wiki/3rd-Party-Modules for more modules to add to your mirror. 

Part 2: (Coming soon). Installer prompts you for location and weather ID in order to display correct weather and set time zone.

Part 3: (Coming soon). DIY Dads building a MagicMirror the hardware.

If you want to extend your mirror further you are best to head to the Magic Mirror offical site at https://magicmirror.builders/

# Quick Tips

# Rotate Display
Rotate the display to portrait mode if your mirror isnâ€™t landscape: Either SSH into your pi or use a terminal on the pi

sudo nano /boot/config.txt

Add the following line to the file:

display_rotate=1

# Wifi
If you have wireless you will need to follow this guide, to exit MagicMirror press Ctrl + Q (if it restarts open a terminal prompt and type pm2 stop mm): https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/desktop.md

# Location

Exit MagicMirror by pressing Ctrl + Q (if it restarts open a terminal prompt and type pm2 stop mm). Click on the Raspberry -> Preferences -> Raspberry Pi Configuration. Then click Localisation. Set Timezone. (I will be automating this in Part 2).
