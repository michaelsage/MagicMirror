# MagicMirror

Following on from my daughter and I building a couple of magic mirrors, there was a lot of interest in creating a how to. 

On this site you will find a basic howto as well as a complete RPi image and a couple of scripts to make creating a MM really easy.

Part 1: Complete pre-configured MagicMirror Image (message comments edited to avoid embarassing "Hey Sexy!" messages). This version pulls the news from the BBC site. This image auto starts Magic Mirror on boot and stops the monitor from sleeping. Just take the img file and write it to an SD card, following these instructions:

This Image was last updated on 22/09/2018.

Take the SD card and put it in a Raspberry Pi and MM will start and away you go. Take a look at https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/wiki/3rd-Party-Modules for more modules to add to your mirror. 

Part 2: (Coming soon). Installer prompts you for location and weather ID in order to display weather local to you.

Part 3: (Coming soon). DIY Dads building a MagicMirror the hardware.

If you want to extend your mirror further you are best to head to the Magic Mirror offical site at https://magicmirror.builders/

Add the following line to the file:
